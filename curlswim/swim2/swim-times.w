@* Swim Times.

This is a program written using Donald Knuth's literate programming paradigm (see more below).
It fetches best short-course yard (SCY) and long-course meter (LCM) times
for a roster of swimmers.  The roster began with four family swimmers:

\medskip
$${\vbox{
\item{} {\bf Stella Julianna Evans} --- 10~\&~Under Girls

\item{} {\bf Kalea Rose Benavente} --- 13--14 Girls

\item {} {\bf Kenneth Ray Evans} --- 11--12 Boys

\item{} {\bf Keith Santiago Evans} --- 11--12 Boys
}}$$

\medskip\noindent
and now also covers Katie Ledecky (as age-group windows) and the full
College~Area Swim~Team (CAST) roster listed in the |SWIMMERS| table of
the main program.  Each swimmer carries a unique {\it id\/} used to
select her on the command line; the ids are enumerated in the software
requirements specification (\.{swim-times-srs.tex}).
Thirty-one events are reported for each swimmer.
Short-course yard (SCY) events: 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 1650~Freestyle;
50 and 100~Butterfly; 50 and 100~Backstroke; 50 and 100~Breaststroke;
and 100 and 200~Individual Medley.
Long-course meter (LCM) events: 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1500~Freestyle;
50, 100, and 200~Butterfly; 50, 100, and 200~Backstroke;
50, 100, and 200~Breaststroke; and 200 and 400~Individual Medley.
Data is fetched live from the USA~Swimming data hub's public REST
services at \.{times-api.usaswimming.org}.

@ {\bf How it works.}  The data hub was formerly powered by a Sisense
JAQL analytics API; it has since moved to first-party REST services,
and this program follows.  We make two kinds of requests:

\medskip\item{1.} A {\it member search\/} (\.{GetMembersForFilters}) to
  resolve the swimmer's |memberId|, given a name string and a substring
  to match the returned full name.

\item{2.} A {\it best-times fetch\/} (\.{GetBestTimesForMember}) that
  returns the member's best time in every event at once; each record
  delivers a stroke, distance, course, and formatted time, from which
  the event code (e.g.\ \.{100 FR SCY}) is reassembled.  The anonymous
  feed carries no swim date, meet, or standard.
\medskip

All HTTP communication is handled by \.{libcurl}.  JSON responses are
scanned with simple string operations rather than a full parse tree.

@ {\bf Literate programming.}
Donald Knuth introduced {\it literate programming\/} in 1984 as a way of
writing software that is meant to be read by human beings first and executed
by computers second.  Rather than annotating code with comments, a literate
program interweaves prose and code in a single source document.  The prose
explains the {\it why\/}---the motivation, the design decisions, the
mathematical reasoning---while the code expresses the {\it how}.  The two
live together in one file (conventionally given the extension \.{.w}) and
are separated only at build time by two companion tools: \.{ctangle} and
\.{cweave}.

@ {\bf ctangle.}
\.{ctangle} is the {\it tangling\/} tool.  It reads a \.{.w} source file
and extracts the C~code sections, assembling them in the order dictated
by named chunk references rather than the order in which they appear in
the document.  The result is a plain
\.{.c} file that a standard C~compiler can process without any knowledge
of literate programming.  In this project, running
$$\.{ctangle swim-times.w}$$
produces \.{swim-times.c}, which is then compiled with \.{cc} and
linked against \.{libcurl} to create the \.{swim-times} executable.
The generated \.{.c} file should be treated as a build artefact: the
\.{.w} file is the true source of record.

@ {\bf cweave.}
\.{cweave} is the {\it weaving\/} tool.  It reads the same \.{.w} source
and produces a \.{.tex} file formatted for \.{pdftex} using the
\.{cwebmac} macro package.  \.{cweave} pretty-prints all C~code with
bold keywords, italic identifiers, and cross-references, and numbers every
named chunk so the reader can follow the program's logical structure
independently of its physical layout.  An index of identifiers and a table
of contents are generated automatically.  Running
$$\.{cweave swim-times.w}$$
produces \.{swim-times.tex}; running \.{pdftex} on that file yields the
typeset documentation you are reading now.

@ {\bf Compilation.}  After tangling with \.{ctangle}:
$$\.{gcc -O2 -o swim-times swim-times.c \$(curl-config --libs)}$$

@ {\bf Program structure.}  The top-level arrangement of the tangled
output is:

@* Includes and constants.

@ @<Includes@>=
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <curl/curl.h>
#include <libpq-fe.h>

@ |TIMES_API| is the base URL of the USA~Swimming public times service
that backs \.{data.usaswimming.org}.  |EVENTS| lists all
event codes we query: twelve short-course yard (SCY) events plus
two additional SCY distance events (1000~FR and 1650~FR) and seventeen
long-course meter (LCM) events, for a total of thirty-one.

The global constants are split into three sub-modules so that no
single module exceeds twenty-four lines.

@<Global constants@>=
@<Numeric constants@>
@<Data hub credentials@>
@<Event table@>

@ The two numeric limits used throughout the program.

@<Numeric constants@>=
#define NUM_EVENTS 31
#define MAX_TIMES  200

@ The base URL of the times service.  Note there is deliberately no
hard-coded bearer token here.  The USA~Swimming data hub retired the
Sisense JAQL API this program originally targeted (its embedded token
now returns \.{401 db\_unauthorized}, and the current front-end no
longer exposes any Sisense credential).  The replacement REST services
at \.{times-api.usaswimming.org} authenticate anonymous callers not
with a bearer token but with three custom headers --- |Usas-Sub-Id:
Anonymous|, |AppName: DataHub|, and a client-generated |Device-Id|.
The |Device-Id| is minted at run time by |build_device_id| (see the
HTTP utilities), so the ``token'' is obtained dynamically on every run
rather than baked into the source.

@<Data hub credentials@>=
static const char TIMES_API[] =
    "https://times-api.usaswimming.org/swims/TimesSearch";

@ The event-code table is split into SCY and LCM sub-lists so the
array initialiser fits within the line limit.

@<Event table@>=
static const char *EVENTS[NUM_EVENTS] = {
    @<SCY events@>
    @<LCM events@>
};

@ The fourteen short-course yard event codes.

@<SCY events@>=
"50 FR SCY",  "100 FR SCY", "200 FR SCY", "500 FR SCY",
"1000 FR SCY", "1650 FR SCY",
"50 FL SCY",  "100 FL SCY",
"50 BK SCY",  "100 BK SCY",
"50 BR SCY",  "100 BR SCY",
"100 IM SCY", "200 IM SCY",

@ The seventeen long-course meter event codes.

"50 BR LCM",   "100 BR LCM",  "200 BR LCM",
"200 IM LCM",  "400 IM LCM"

@ The program accepts two optional flags on the command line.

The \.{-o} flag takes a comma-separated list of one or more tokens.
A token is either one of four {\it behaviour keywords\/} or a
{\it swimmer id\/}:
\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} \.{fastest} --- print only the single fastest time per event.
\item{$\bullet$} \.{csv} --- emit CSV lines (swimmer name on every line) instead of a table.
\item{$\bullet$} \.{store} --- write each row to the local Postgres
    database \.{swim-times} via \.{libpq}; combine with \.{csv} to also
    print to the terminal.
\item{$\bullet$} \.{offline} --- skip all network calls; read times from
    the local Postgres \.{swim-times} database instead.
\medskip\noindent
Any other token is treated as a swimmer id (e.g.\ \.{stella}, \.{kalea},
\.{ledecky14}, \.{glass-layla}); see the |SWIMMERS| roster for the full
list.  When no swimmer id is given every swimmer is processed.
Tokens may be combined, e.g.\ \.{-o stella,fastest} or
\.{-o kalea,csv,store}.
When no swimmer keyword is specified all swimmers (subject to mode) are shown.

The \.{-e} flag takes one or more comma-separated event codes
(e.g.\ \.{-e "100 FR SCY,50 FL LCM"}) and restricts output to those events
only.  The flag may also be repeated (e.g.\ \.{-e "100 FR SCY" -e "50 FL LCM"}).
When \.{-e} is omitted all thirty-one events are reported.

If no options are given at all the program prints a usage message and exits.

@<Option flags@>=
#define OPT_FASTEST   (1<<0)  /* print only the single fastest time       */
#define OPT_CSV       (1<<1)  /* emit CSV lines instead of a table        */
#define OPT_STORE     (1<<2)  /* also persist rows to Postgres            */
#define OPT_OFFLINE   (1<<3)  /* read from Postgres, skip network         */

@ These are the behaviour flags (how to render or where to read/write).
Swimmer {\it selection\/}---which people to fetch---is no longer encoded
as one bit per swimmer, because the roster now holds several dozen
entries and would overflow the flag word.  Instead each swimmer carries
a unique string |id| (see the |Swimmer| record) and any \.{-o} token
that is not one of the four behaviour keywords above is treated as a
swimmer id and pushed onto |g_sel|.  When |g_nsel| is zero every swimmer
is processed; otherwise only those whose |id| appears in |g_sel|.

@<Option flags@>+=
#define MAX_SEL 64            /* max distinct swimmer ids selectable at once */
static int         g_opts    = 0;  /* behaviour flags; see above            */
static const char *g_sel[MAX_SEL]; /* selected swimmer ids (heap copies)    */
static int         g_nsel    = 0;  /* number of entries in |g_sel|          */
static char g_events[NUM_EVENTS][32]; /* event codes requested via \.{-e}  */
static int  g_nevents = 0;  /* number of entries in |g_events|             */

@* Data structures.

@ A |Buffer| holds a dynamically-grown heap string.  \.{libcurl}
appends each response chunk to it via the write callback.

@<Type definitions@>=
typedef struct {
    char  *data;
    size_t size;
} Buffer;

@ A |TimeRow| records one swim result.  |sort_key| is the swim time in
seconds (smaller is faster), computed by |time_to_seconds|; |time| is
the formatted string (e.g.\ \.{1:02.45}); |date| is the swim date
formatted as \.{YYYY-MM-DD}; |standard| is the motivational standard
attained (e.g.\ \.{B}, \.{BB}, \.{A}); and |meet| is the meet name.
Under the anonymous best-times feed only |time| and |sort_key| are
populated; |date|, |standard|, and |meet| are left empty.

@<Type definitions@>+=
typedef struct {
    double sort_key;
    char   time[32];
    char   date[16];
    char   standard[48];
    char   meet[256];
} TimeRow;

@ A |Swimmer| record holds the per-swimmer search parameters: a query
string sent to the person-search API, a lower-case substring used to
identify the correct row, a flag bit used to filter output, and an
optional age window expressed as ISO~\.{YYYY-MM-DD} dates.  The
typedef lives in this section (rather than next to the |SWIMMERS|
array in main) so that |offline_fetch| can reference it without a
forward declaration.

@<Type definitions@>+=
typedef struct {
    const char *id;            /* unique selection id, e.g.\ "stella"   */
    const char *search_query;  /* Name string to search for             */
    const char *match_substr;  /* Lower-case substring to match         */
    const char *date_min;      /* NULL or "YYYY-MM-DD" inclusive lower  */
    const char *date_max;      /* NULL or "YYYY-MM-DD" inclusive upper  */
} Swimmer;

@* HTTP utilities.

@ The \.{libcurl} write callback appends each incoming chunk to a
|Buffer|, growing the allocation as needed.  It maintains a null
terminator so the buffer can always be treated as a C string.

@<HTTP utilities@>=
static size_t write_cb(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *ud)
{
    Buffer *b = (Buffer *)ud;
    size_t  n = size * nmemb;
    char   *p = realloc(b->data, b->size + n + 1);
    if (!p) return 0;
    b->data = p;
    memcpy(b->data + b->size, ptr, n);
    b->size += n;
    b->data[b->size] = '\0';
    return n;
}

@ |base64| encodes a null-terminated string into standard base64.  It is
used only to shape the |Device-Id| header, so a compact implementation
that never overflows |out| is all that is required.

@<HTTP utilities@>+=
static const char B64[] =
  "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/";

static void base64(const char *in, char *out, size_t out_sz)
{
    size_t len = strlen(in), i = 0, o = 0;
    while (i + 3 <= len && o + 4 < out_sz) {
        unsigned t = ((unsigned char)in[i]   << 16) |
                     ((unsigned char)in[i+1] <<  8) |
                      (unsigned char)in[i+2];
        out[o++] = B64[(t>>18)&63]; out[o++] = B64[(t>>12)&63];
        out[o++] = B64[(t>> 6)&63]; out[o++] = B64[t&63];
        i += 3;
    }
    if (len > i && o + 4 < out_sz) {
        size_t rem = len - i;
        unsigned t = (unsigned char)in[i] << 16;
        if (rem == 2) t |= (unsigned char)in[i+1] << 8;
        out[o++] = B64[(t>>18)&63];        out[o++] = B64[(t>>12)&63];
        out[o++] = rem==2 ? B64[(t>>6)&63] : '='; out[o++] = '=';
    }
    out[o] = '\0';
}

@ |device_id| returns the cached |Device-Id| value the times service
requires, building it once on first use.  We reproduce the shape the
data hub's front-end produces: base64 of \.{"platform - vendor -
fingerprint - millis"}, then the first five characters repeated after
the fifteenth.  The server validates only the format, so a per-run
fingerprint (process id plus clock) is sufficient.

@<HTTP utilities@>+=
static const char *device_id(void)
{
    static char id[512];
    if (id[0]) return id;
    char raw[128], n[256];
    long now = (long)time(NULL);
    snprintf(raw, sizeof raw, "Linux - curlswim - %lx%lx - %ld000",
             (unsigned long)getpid(), (unsigned long)now, now);
    base64(raw, n, sizeof n);
    snprintf(id, sizeof id, "%.15s%.5s%s", n, n, n + 15);
    return id;
}

@ |http_request| performs one request --- a |GET| when |body| is |NULL|,
otherwise a |POST| carrying |body| --- and returns the response as a
null-terminated heap string, or |NULL| on failure.  The caller frees the
result.  Every request carries the anonymous data-hub headers instead of
a bearer token.

if (!curl) return NULL;

Buffer buf = {NULL, 0};

char dev_hdr[560];
snprintf(dev_hdr, sizeof dev_hdr, "Device-Id: %s", device_id());

curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_cb);
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA,     &buf);

@ The request is executed; on success the accumulated buffer is returned
to the caller; on failure the partial buffer is freed and |NULL| is returned.

curl_slist_free_all(hdrs);
curl_easy_cleanup(curl);

if (rc != CURLE_OK) { free(buf.data); return NULL; }
return buf.data;

@* JSON scanner.

@ The REST responses are JSON arrays of objects with named fields.  A
member-search row looks like
$$\hbox{\.{{"memberId":"6CD35348E5824C","fullName":"Katie Genevieve Ledecky",\dots}}}$$
and a best-times row like
$$\hbox{\.{{"strokeAbbreviation":"FR","distance":50,"courseCode":"SCY","swimTime":"22.64r"}}}$$

Rather than build a full parse tree we scan forward for a named key and
extract the immediately following value, advancing a position pointer.
The scanner is format-agnostic: it served the old Sisense
|"text"|/|"data"| cells and serves these named fields unchanged.

@ |scan_string| finds the first |"key"| at or after |*pos|, copies the
string value that follows into |out| (at most |max_len-1| bytes), and
advances |*pos| past it.  Returns 1 on success, 0 if the key is absent.

@<JSON scanner@>=
static int scan_string(const char *key, const char **pos,
                       char *out, size_t max_len)
{
    char needle[128];
    snprintf(needle, sizeof needle, "\"%s\"", key);
    const char *p = strstr(*pos, needle);
    if (!p) return 0;
    p += strlen(needle);
    while (*p == ' ' || *p == ':') p++;
    if (*p != '"') return 0;
    p++;
    const char *e = strchr(p, '"');
    if (!e) return 0;
    size_t len = (size_t)(e - p);
    if (len >= max_len) len = max_len - 1;
    memcpy(out, p, len);
    out[len] = '\0';
    *pos = e + 1;
    return 1;
}

@ |scan_long| is the numeric counterpart: it finds |"key"|, converts
the digits that follow to a |long|, stores the result in |*out|, and
advances |*pos|.

@<JSON scanner@>+=
static int scan_long(const char *key, const char **pos, long *out)
{
    char needle[128];
    snprintf(needle, sizeof needle, "\"%s\"", key);
    const char *p = strstr(*pos, needle);
    if (!p) return 0;
    p += strlen(needle);
    while (*p == ' ' || *p == ':') p++;
    char *end;
    *out = strtol(p, &end, 10);
    if (end == p) return 0;
    *pos = end;
    return 1;
}

@* Database connection.

@ The \.{store} option streams rows into the local Postgres database
\.{swim-times}; the \.{offline} option reads previously-stored rows
back.  Both reach Postgres {\it programmatically\/} via the standard
client library \.{libpq} --- no \.{psql} child process or wrapper
script is involved (this is requirement~\#3 of \.{requirements4.txt}:
``Access the Postgres database programmatically, not through scripts'').
A connection string can be supplied via the |SWIM_TIMES_PGCONNINFO|
environment variable; if unset the program connects to a local
container with the keyword string
\.{dbname=swim-times user=postgres host=localhost port=5432}.
Per-row inserts use \.{INSERT \dots\ ON CONFLICT \dots\ DO NOTHING}
keyed on the unique tuple
\.{(swimmer, event, swim\_time, swim\_date, meet)} so a duplicate
silently no-ops without aborting the surrounding work
(requirement~\#4: ``check for duplicates before adding \dots\ and
recover appropriately'').

@<Database pipe@>=
@<Resolve connection string@>
@<Open and close DB connection@>
@<Insert one row@>

@ |db_conn_string| returns the libpq connection string.  Override

}

@ |db_open| opens a libpq connection and prepares the parameterised
\.{INSERT \dots\ ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING} statement that all
\code{store} writes use.  |db_close| releases the connection.  Both
are idempotent.  The \.{ON CONFLICT} clause keys on the same unique
constraint declared by \.{schema.sql}, so a duplicate row is a
no-op rather than an error.

}
PQclear(r);

@ |db_insert_row| executes the prepared statement once for one
\code{TimeRow}.  A duplicate hits the \.{ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING}
branch and is silently absorbed; any other failure logs a warning
but does not abort the run.  An empty |date|, |standard|, or |meet| is
passed as a SQL |NULL| (a |NULL| pointer in the value array) so the
\.{\$4::date} cast does not choke on an empty string; the best-times
feed leaves these fields empty.

@* Person lookup. |lookup_member_id| posts a member search for
|search_query| and scans the result records for one whose full name
contains |match_substr| (after lower-casing).  It returns the
matching swimmer's |memberId| as a heap string (an alphanumeric token
such as \.{6CD35348E5824C}, {\it not\/} the old numeric PersonKey) and,
optionally, the full name in |*out_name|.  Returns |NULL| on failure.
The function body is split into five sub-modules.

@* Times fetch.

@ |insertion_sort| sorts |n| |TimeRow| records in-place by |sort_key|

a few dozen entries per event, so $O(n^2)$ is entirely adequate.

\.{"1:40.36"}, \.{"14:59.62"}) to a |double| number of seconds, used as
the sort key.  Colon-separated groups are accumulated sexagesimally; any
trailing flag character (such as the \.{r} marking a relay lead-off) is

@ |fetch_times| reports |member_id|'s best time in |event_code|.  The
public times service returns a member's whole best-times set in one
\.{GetBestTimesForMember} call, so the response is fetched once and
cached in |g_bt_resp| (keyed by |g_bt_member|); subsequent per-event
calls reuse it.  The best-times feed carries only the event and the
time, so |date|, |meet|, and |standard| are left empty --- those fields
are not exposed to anonymous callers.  The |date_min| and |date_max|
age-window parameters are retained for signature compatibility but no
longer apply.  The body is broken into three sub-modules.

@* Offline fetch.

@ |offline_fetch| is the read counterpart to the insert path: it
issues a parameterised \.{SELECT} via \.{libpq} on the shared

consumed by the shared sort/emit chunk.  No network is touched and
no child process is spawned.  The function takes a |Swimmer|
pointer so it can use both |match_substr| (for an \.{ILIKE} clause
that maps the user keyword to whichever full name the database
happens to hold) and the optional age window
(|date_min|, |date_max|).

@* Main program.

@ We define a small |Swimmer| record to hold the person-search
parameters for each swimmer.  Each entry supplies a unique |id| string
(the token the user passes to \.{-o} to select her), a |search_query|
string sent to the database (ideally distinctive enough to return a
small set), and a |match_substr| (lower-cased) used to identify the
correct row among the results.  The optional |date_min| and |date_max| fields restrict
output to swims whose date falls in $[\hbox{|date_min|}, \hbox{|date_max|}]$
(inclusive, ISO~\.{YYYY-MM-DD}).  These are used to express age-group
windows---for example Katie Ledecky's 9- and 10-year-old swims fall
between her ninth and eleventh birthdays.
Kalea's entry searches ``Benavente'' because the simple two-word query
``Kalea Benavente'' returns no results; the API requires an exact substring
match against the registered name ``Kalea Rose Benavente''.
Kenneth's entry uses ``kenneth ray'' and Keith's uses ``keith santiago''
to avoid false matches on the common surname ``Evans''.
Katie Ledecky was born 17~March~1997, so the window
\.{2006-03-17} through \.{2008-03-16} captures every swim from her
ninth birthday up to (but not including) her eleventh.  The same
construction yields \.{2008-03-17} through \.{2010-03-16} for the
11- and 12-year-old window (\.{ledecky12}) and \.{2010-03-17}
through \.{2012-03-16} for the 13- and 14-year-old window
(\.{ledecky14}).

@* Glossary.

The following terms and interfaces appear throughout this program.

@
\def\gitem#1{\medskip\noindent{\bf #1.}\enspace\ignorespaces}
\def\sig#1{\par\noindent\quad{\tt #1}\par\noindent}

\gitem{USA Swimming times API}
The first-party REST service at \.{times-api.usaswimming.org} that
backs the public data hub at \.{data.usaswimming.org}.  It replaced the
Sisense JAQL analytics API this program originally used (now
decommissioned for public callers).  Requests are ordinary HTTP
\.{GET}/\.{POST} calls returning JSON; the OpenAPI description is
published at \.{.../swagger/v1/swagger.json}.

\gitem{Anonymous data-hub authentication}
The times API uses no bearer token for public data.  Every request
instead carries three headers: \.{Usas-Sub-Id} (the caller's subject,
or the literal \.{Anonymous} when not signed in), \.{AppName: DataHub},
and a \.{Device-Id}.  The server validates the {\it format\/} of the
\.{Device-Id}---base64 of \.{"<platform> - <vendor> - <fingerprint> -
<millis>"} with the first five base64 characters repeated after the
fifteenth---so |device_id| mints a conforming value at run time.

\gitem{memberId}
The service's identifier for a swimmer, an alphanumeric token such as
\.{6CD35348E5824C} (it replaces the old numeric \.{PersonKey}).

@ {\bf USA Swimming REST API Calls.}
Both endpoints live under
\.{https://times-api.usaswimming.org/swims/TimesSearch} and carry
\.{Content-Type: application/json} plus the anonymous auth headers
above.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} {\bf Member search.}
  \.{POST /GetMembersForFilters} with body
  \.{\{"name":"<query>"\}}.  Returns a JSON array of member objects,
  each with (among others) \.{memberId}, \.{fullName}, \.{clubName},
  and \.{lscCode}.  This program scans the array for the first member
  whose lower-cased \.{fullName} contains the match substring and keeps
  that record's \.{memberId}.

\item{$\bullet$} {\bf Best-times fetch.}
  \.{GET /GetBestTimesForMember/\{memberId\}}.  Returns a JSON array
  with one object per event, each carrying \.{strokeAbbreviation},
  \.{distance} (numeric), \.{courseCode}, and \.{swimTime} (formatted).
  The event code is reassembled as \.{"<distance> <stroke> <course>"}
  and matched against the requested event.  The anonymous feed does not
  include swim date, meet name, or motivational standard; the richer
  endpoints that do (\.{GetAllTimesForFilters}, \.{GetSwimmerMeets})
  require a signed-in subject and return \.{403} otherwise.

@ {\bf libcurl API Calls.}
This program uses the libcurl ``easy'' interface for synchronous HTTP.
All functions return a |CURLcode| (zero = \.{CURLE\_OK}) except where
noted.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} {\tt curl\_global\_init(flags)}.
  \par\noindent Parameter: {\tt flags} ({\tt long}) ---
  a bitmask of subsystems to initialise.
  This program passes \.{CURL\_GLOBAL\_DEFAULT}, which enables SSL
  and the Windows socket layer on that platform.
  Must be called once before any other libcurl function.
  Returns a {\tt CURLcode}; this program ignores the return value
  because failure is treated as fatal by the subsequent easy calls.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt curl\_global\_cleanup(void)}.
  Releases all resources allocated by |curl_global_init|.
  Must be called once after all easy handles have been cleaned up.
  Returns nothing.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt curl\_easy\_init(void)}.
  Allocates and returns a new easy handle (a \.{CURL *}).
  Returns \.{NULL} on failure.
  Each call to |http_request| creates its own handle and destroys it
  before returning, so handles are never shared between requests.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt curl\_easy\_setopt(handle, option, value)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt handle} ({\tt CURL *}): the easy handle.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt option} ({\tt CURLoption}): a constant selecting
    the behaviour to configure.  Options used here:
    \itemitem{} \.{CURLOPT\_URL} ({\tt char *}) --- the request URL.
    \itemitem{} \.{CURLOPT\_HTTPHEADER} ({\tt struct curl\_slist *}) ---
      linked list of extra HTTP headers (\.{Content-Type} and the
      anonymous \.{Usas-Sub-Id}, \.{AppName}, \.{Device-Id} headers).
    \itemitem{} \.{CURLOPT\_POSTFIELDS} ({\tt char *}) ---
      the POST body; set only when a body is supplied, which also
      switches the method to POST (best-times fetches are plain GETs).
    \itemitem{} \.{CURLOPT\_WRITEFUNCTION} (function pointer) ---
      callback invoked for each response chunk; signature
      {\tt size\_t cb(void*,size\_t,size\_t,void*)}.
    \itemitem{} \.{CURLOPT\_WRITEDATA} ({\tt void *}) ---
      the user-data pointer passed as the fourth argument to the
      write callback; here a pointer to the |Buffer| accumulator.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt value}: type depends on {\tt option} (see above).

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt curl\_easy\_perform(handle)}.
  \par\noindent Parameter: {\tt handle} ({\tt CURL *}).
  Executes the configured request synchronously, invoking the write
  callback for each received chunk.
  Returns \.{CURLE\_OK} on success or a non-zero error code; on failure
  |http_request| frees the partial buffer and returns \.{NULL}.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt curl\_easy\_cleanup(handle)}.
  \par\noindent Parameter: {\tt handle} ({\tt CURL *}).
  Releases all resources associated with the handle.
  The handle must not be used after this call.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt curl\_slist\_append(list, string)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt list} ({\tt struct curl\_slist *}):
    existing list head, or \.{NULL} to start a new list.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt string} ({\tt const char *}): the string to append.
  Returns the new list head, or \.{NULL} on allocation failure.
  Used to build the two-header list
  (\.{Content-Type} then \.{Authorization}).

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt curl\_slist\_free\_all(list)}.
  \par\noindent Parameter: {\tt list} ({\tt struct curl\_slist *}).
  Frees every node in the linked list.
  Called immediately after |curl_easy_perform| so the headers are
  released before the handle.

@ {\bf POSIX System Calls and Library Functions.}
The following identifiers from the POSIX.1-2008 standard are used
directly in this program.  Each entry gives the C~signature, a
description of each parameter, and a note on how the program uses it.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} {\tt int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *fmt, ...)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt stream}: destination file (\.{stderr} here).
  \itemitem{--} {\tt fmt}: printf-style format string.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt ...}: values substituted into {\tt fmt}.
  Writes formatted output to {\tt stream}; returns the character count
  or a negative value on error.
  Used to report lookup and HTTP failures to standard error.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt int fputs(const char *s, FILE *stream)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt s}: null-terminated string to write.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt stream}: destination file (\.{stderr} here).
  Writes {\tt s} without a trailing newline; returns non-negative on
  success or \.{EOF} on error.
  Used for fixed error messages where no formatting is needed.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt void free(void *ptr)}.
  \par\noindent Parameter:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt ptr}: pointer to a heap block, or \.{NULL}
    (in which case nothing happens).
  Releases the block back to the heap.
  Called on every heap string (response buffers, duplicated names and
  keys) when they are no longer needed.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt void *memcpy(void *dst, const void *src, size\_t n)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt dst}: destination address.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt src}: source address.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt n}: number of bytes to copy.
  Copies exactly {\tt n} bytes from {\tt src} to {\tt dst};
  regions must not overlap.
  Returns {\tt dst}.
  Used in |write_cb| to append each network chunk to the buffer,
  and in |scan_string| to copy a JSON string value.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt int printf(const char *fmt, ...)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt fmt}: printf-style format string.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt ...}: values substituted into {\tt fmt}.
  Writes formatted output to standard output; returns the character
  count or a negative value on error.
  Used for all swimmer and time-table output.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt int putchar(int c)}.
  \par\noindent Parameter:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt c}: character value (as {\tt unsigned char} cast
    to {\tt int}).
  Writes one character to standard output; returns the character
  written, or \.{EOF} on error.
  Used to emit a blank line (\.{'\char`\\n'}) after each event section.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt void *realloc(void *ptr, size\_t size)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt ptr}: existing heap block, or \.{NULL}.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt size}: new size in bytes.
  Returns a pointer to the resized block (possibly moved), or \.{NULL}
  if allocation fails (the original block is unchanged on failure).
  When {\tt ptr} is \.{NULL} the call is equivalent to {\tt malloc}.
  Used in |write_cb| to grow the response buffer incrementally as
  libcurl delivers each chunk.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt int snprintf(char *buf, size\_t n, const char *fmt, ...)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt buf}: destination character array.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt n}: maximum bytes to write, including the null terminator.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt fmt}: printf-style format string.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt ...}: values substituted into {\tt fmt}.
  Writes at most {\tt n}$-1$ formatted characters to {\tt buf} and
  always null-terminates.  Returns the number of characters that would
  have been written had the buffer been unlimited (so a return value
  $\ge${\tt n} signals truncation).
  Used to assemble URL strings, JSON bodies, and the bearer-token header.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt char *strchr(const char *s, int c)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt s}: string to search.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt c}: character to find (compared as {\tt unsigned char}).
  Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of {\tt c} in {\tt s},
  including the terminator if {\tt c} is \.{'\char`\\0'}, or \.{NULL}.
  Used in |scan_string| to find the closing double-quote of a JSON
  string value.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt char *strdup(const char *s)}.
  \par\noindent Parameter:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt s}: null-terminated string to duplicate.
  Allocates a new heap block of {\tt strlen(s)+1} bytes, copies
  {\tt s} into it, and returns the pointer; returns \.{NULL} on failure.
  Used in |lookup_member_id| to persist the swimmer's full name and
  memberId string across the lifetime of a query.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt size\_t strlen(const char *s)}.
  \par\noindent Parameter:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt s}: null-terminated string.
  Returns the number of bytes before the null terminator.
  Used to compute loop bounds when lower-casing names and to advance
  past a search needle in |scan_string| and |scan_long|.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt char *strncpy(char *dst, const char *src, size\_t n)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt dst}: destination array (at least {\tt n} bytes).
  \itemitem{--} {\tt src}: source string.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt n}: maximum bytes to copy.
  Copies up to {\tt n} bytes; if {\tt src} is shorter than {\tt n},
  the remainder of {\tt dst} is zero-filled.  If {\tt src} is at least
  {\tt n} bytes long, {\tt dst} will {\it not\/} be null-terminated.
  Returns {\tt dst}.
  This program always writes {\tt dst[sizeof dst - 1] = '\char`\\0'}
  after the call to guarantee termination.
  Used to copy the swimmer name and requested event codes; fixed
  {\tt TimeRow} fields are filled with |snprintf| instead.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt char *strstr(const char *hay, const char *needle)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt hay}: string to search within.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt needle}: substring to search for.
  Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of {\tt needle} in
  {\tt hay}, or \.{NULL} if not found.
  The workhorse of the JSON scanner: used to locate key names
  (\.{"memberId"}, \.{"fullName"}, \.{"swimTime"}, \dots) and to
  advance through the raw REST response text.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt double strtod(const char *s, char **endptr)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt s}: string containing a floating-point number.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt endptr}: if non-\.{NULL}, receives a pointer to the
    first character not consumed by the conversion.
  Returns the parsed {\tt double}; sets {\tt *endptr} past the
  converted text.
  Used by |time_to_seconds| to convert each colon-separated group of a
  formatted time (e.g.\ \.{"1:40.36"}) to a {\tt double} sort key.

\item{$\bullet$} {\tt long strtol(const char *s, char **endptr, int base)}.
  \par\noindent Parameters:
  \itemitem{--} {\tt s}: string containing an integer.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt endptr}: if non-\.{NULL}, receives a pointer to the
    first character not consumed.
  \itemitem{--} {\tt base}: numeric base (2--36), or 0 for auto-detection
    from a \.{0x} or \.{0} prefix.  This program passes 10 (decimal).
  Returns the parsed {\tt long}; sets {\tt *endptr} past the converted
  text.  Used in |scan_long| to read the numeric \.{distance} field
  from the JSON best-times response.
